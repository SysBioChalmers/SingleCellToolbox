AdjustPval.m;T0005
CalcDSAVE.m;"No test case; tested with figure 3A and 3E in Supplementary information."
Celltype.m;Not tested, just a declaration
CelltypeId2CelltypeName.m;Not tested, just a number to text conversion function
CreateVennDiagramSets.m;T0017
DSAVEAlignDataset.m;T0018, Figure 2 B-C in the paper.
DSAVEGenerateTemplateInfo.m;T0019, also implicitly tested in  Figure 2 B-C in the paper.
DSAVEGetGeneVariation.m;T0026
DSAVEGetSingleCellDivergence.m;T0021. LogMultinomialPDF was tested with T0016. The graphs 5 C-D shows that the divergence reflects known QC metrics.
DSAVEGetStandardTemplate.m;T0019
DSAVEGetTotalVariationVsPoolSize.m;"T0023 tests this partly; the values also look as expected in figure 1 A-C in the main paper."
DSAVEGetTotalVariationFromBulk.m;T0022
GenerateSamplingSSDataset.m;T0020 partly tests the function. Also implicitly verified since Figure 3A in supplementary information shows that different datasets with the same noise get similar scores, and that this function is used for generating them.
GenerateTotalVariationGraphs.m;Not tested, this is just code for generating graphs
ImportTabSepSamples.m;Not tested, a simple load function
LogMultinomialPDF.m;T0016
ProgressBar.m;Not tested, just a graphical effect when running scripts
Read10xMatrix.m;Verified as part of Read functions for datasets
ReadBC2.m;T0007
ReadGSE112845.m;T0008, only tested CD8+ part, which is the only one used
ReadHCACordBlood.m;Difficult to test since the data files are difficult to read manually. Verified with a tsne plot and  coloring of cell types, which looks ok
ReadLiverTCells.m;T0009
ReadLung50000.m;T0006
ReadOvarianAscites.m;T0010
ReadPBMC68000.m;T0011
ReadPBMCB10000.m;T0012
ReadPBMCTCD4Mem10000.m;T0013
RelativeImportanceScript.R;Not tested, this is just code for generating graph data
Samples.m;T0014
SCDataset.m;T0001,T0002,T0003
SCDep.m;Not tested, just a loading wrapper for datasets, pretty obvious if it doesn't work.
SynchronizeGenes.m;T0004
TPM.m;T0015
ProgrBar.m;T0024
ProgrBarChild.m;T0024
ProgrBarContext.m;T0024
DSAVEInstall;Tested manually, works.
